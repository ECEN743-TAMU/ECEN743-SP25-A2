    "## Introduction of the FrozenLake Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Frozen lake involves crossing a frozen lake from start to goal without falling into any holes by walking over the frozen lake. The player may not always move in the intended direction due to the slippery nature of the frozen lake. The game starts with the player at location [0,0] of the frozen lake grid world with the goal located at far extent of the world e.g. [3,3] for the 4x4 environment. Holes in the ice are distributed in set locations using a pre-determined map, and the player makes moves until they reach the goal or fall in a hole. The map is given below for your reference\n",

    "    \n",
    "### Action Space\n",
    "The player/agent can take 4 discrete actions, in the range {0,3}\n",
    "* 0: Move left\n",
    "* 1: Move down\n",
    "* 2: Move right \n",
    "* 4: Move up\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### State Space\n",
    "The environment consists of 16 states. The state is a value representing the player’s current position as current_row * nrows + current_col (where both the row and col start at 0).\n",
    "For example, the goal position in the 4x4 map can be calculated as follows: 3 * 4 + 3 = 15.\n",
    "\n",

    "* Reach goal: +1\n",
    "* Reach hole: 0\n",
    "* Reach frozen: 0\n",
    "\n",
    "### Episode End\n",
    "The episode ends if the following happens:\n",
    "#### 1.Termination:\n",
    "* The player moves into a hole.\n",
    "* The player reaches the goal at max(nrow) * max(ncol) - 1 (location [max(nrow)-1, max(ncol)-1]).\n",

    "* The environment is slippery, ie., the transition kernel is stochastic.\n",

    "### The decay of learning rate and exploration factor\n",
    "We aim to learn the optimal Q-value function through online exploration. Intuitively, after sufficient exploration, our learner should already have good amount of awareness in the scary FrozenLake. Too much exploration results in a sub-optimal policy. Hence, we should dynamically adjust our exploration scheme.\n",
    "\n",
    "The convergence of an online learning algorithm is highly correlated to the stochasticity of the environment. As a result, you may see your Q-value function fluctuates frequently. This could be because the learner just faced a bad episode! However, after training for a while, your learner should have seen sufficient number of both good and bad episodes. Decaying the learning rate can help the algorithm to converge to the optimal policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your Task\n",
    "1. Implement `lr_decay` and `epsilon_decay`. Experiment with linear decay, exponential decay, etc. You do not need to find **THE** best decay scheme.\n",
    "2. Implement `epsilon_greedy'. One way to do this is to sample a Bernoulli random variable with parameter $\\epsilon$. Note that, $\\epsilon$ is the probability that **you choose a random action instead of the greedy action**.\n",
    "3. Implement Q-Learning update."
